Turnover is a key indicator of economic activity, but we know little about how much entrepreneurs actually adjust it as a response to taxation or other costs. This paper exploits the notches created by the eligibility cut-offs of the preferential tax regimes for solo self-employed in Italy to estimate the elasticity of turnover. I find large bunching below some of the cut-offs, with heterogeneous responses across sectors. Bunching is particularly large for the group “Professionals and Financial services’’. Building on the model by Kleven and Waseem (2013), I show that, in presence of heterogeneous incentives to bunch, the elasticity of turnover can be estimated by exploiting the indifference condition of the last marginal buncher, that is the the marginal buncher with the highest pre-notch turnover.
