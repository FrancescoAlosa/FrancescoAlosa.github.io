I exploit the notches created by the eligibility cut-offs of the preferential tax regimes for solo self-employed in Italy to estimate the elasticity of turnover. While there is extensive evidence of bunching on taxable income for self-employed and businesses, taxable income is made of several components (turnover, costs, deductions, ...) and can manipulated in many different ways. This paper focuses on a single element of taxable income -- turnover -- and investigates to what extent solo self-employed manipulate precisely its level to minimise tax liabilities. I find large bunching below some of the cut-offs, with heterogeneous responses across sectors. Bunching is particularly large for the group "Professionals and Financial services''. A new theoretical framework is developed to estimate the elasticity of turnover.
