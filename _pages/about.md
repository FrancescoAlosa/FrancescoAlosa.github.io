Hi! I am a PhD candidate at University of Bologna and a member of the Uppsala Center for Fiscal Studies (UCFS). **I will be on the 2023/2024 job market**. 

My area of research is **Public Economics**, both from a theoretical and empirical perspective. My theoretical research looks at optimal public good provision and capital income taxation. My empirical research examines how taxpayers respond to the incentives of the tax system.
