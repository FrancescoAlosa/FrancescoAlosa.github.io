**Estimating the Elasticity of Turnover from Bunching: Preferential Tax Regimes for Solo Self-employed in Italy**.  <br/>

Turnover is a key indicator of economic activity, but we know little about how much entrepreneurs adjust it as a response to taxation. This is because business taxation is usually based on profits, rather than turnover. This paper exploits the notch created by the eligibility cut-off of the preferential (turnover) tax regime for solo self-employed in Italy to study turnover responses to taxation. I find that solo self-employed bunch below the turnover threshold to be eligible for the preferential scheme. Effects are different in different sectors, with professionals and business intermediaries showing the largest responses. I estimate the turnover tax elasticity by focusing on the (last) marginal buncher. To do so, I adapt the models of Kleven and Waseem (2013) and Harju et al. (2019) to derive a modified indifference condition that fits the institutional set-up. Finally, this paper also documents profit responses. After the introduction of the preferential turnover regime, I find that many self-employed target specific profitability levels, even if that is not required to access the tax scheme.

**Optimal Taxation and Public Good Provision with Heterogeneous Risk Preferences**.  <br/>
<small>[ <a href="#/" onclick="visib('optimal-tax')">Abstract</a> ]</small>


<div id="optimal-tax" style="display: none; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.2" ><small>
This paper investigates the optimal taxation of risky and safe capital income when heterogeneous returns are driven by heterogeneous risk preferences, and (risky) tax revenues finance a (risky) public good that provides insurance against aggregate risk. Agents make intertemporal consumption and portfolio decisions over a two-period horizon, choosing between two types of assets: one riskless, and one being subject to aggregate risk. The main theoretical result is that the optimal variance of the public good is set by the excess return tax to balance different agents’ “demands” for insurance. Moreover, a trade-off between insurance and intertemporal efficiency can arise, and taxing the safe return can be optimal. Numerical simulations show that the (risky) public good has a lower expected value and variance if the government gives more weight to the most risk averse agents: safer individual prospects must match with a safer public policy.
